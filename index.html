            <p>From the episode / scene data set it can be observed that the average number of characters per scene is 2.91, 
                which indicates that most scenes are rather 'intimate' with only a few characters. This reveals that the show 
                places a strong emphasis on character development and dynamics . However, it is worth noting that the data set 
                may not accurately represent the number of characters present in large-scale battle scenes, which could skew this 
                average higher. In addition, the average number of scenes per character is 20.99. There is a total of 4165 scenes 
                in the entire TV-show, meaning that many characters do not appear that often. However, as can be observed from the 
                plot below, the main characters do appear way more than the average, indicating that a small subset of characters 
                plays a significant role in driving the narrative forward.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Throughout the entirety of Game of Thrones, Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, and Daenerys Targaryen have the most number of scenes. 
                It is worth noting the development of the number of scenes for each character throughout the series.</p>

            <p>In the first four seasons, all of the main characters, including Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys, have roughly 
                the same number of scenes, with Tyrion having a slightly higher number. As the show progresses, and various 
                character arcs merge, there is a significant shift in which characters are considered main characters and which 
                are relegated to supporting roles. This shift is reflected in the number of scenes each character appears in, 
                with Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon having a significant increase in the number of scenes they appear in, leaving a 
                significant gap between them and the other characters.</p>
                
            <p>Arya Stark, Bran Stark, Sansa Stark, and Cersei Lannister are grouped together with a similar number of scenes, 
                but their character arcs are more side-arcs compared to the journeys of the top three characters. They all have 
                their own distinct storylines, but they are not central to the overarching plot of the show to the same extent as 
                Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys.</p>
                
            <p>Jorah Mormont, Jaime Lannister, and Davos Seaworth, on the other hand, occupy a spot in the lower end of the top 
                ten characters with the most number of scenes. This can be attributed to the fact that they serve as primary 
                supporting characters for Jon, Daenerys, and Tyrion, respectively, and are not central to the show's main plot.

            <p>
                In our study of the Game of Thrones universe, we employed sentiment analysis to gain deeper insights into the emotional 
                landscape of the show. This involved preprocessing the textual data using natural language processing tools such as nltk,
                 which enabled us to eliminate stop words and streamline the text for further analysis. To ensure the focus remained on 
                 meaningful words, we compiled a list of the 1000 most common words to filter out less interesting terms.

            </p>
            <p>
                To perform sentiment analysis on the characters' dialogues, we used the Distilled BERT model, a powerful and efficient 
                natural language understanding model. By applying this model to the dialogues, we tracked the sentiment of each character 
                throughout the series, observing how their emotions evolved over the different seasons. Additionally, we applied this 
                approach to Louvain communities based on co-scenes, which provided further insights into the relationships between characters 
                and their shared experiences.

            </p>
            <p>
                The results of our sentiment analysis were both informative and accurate, allowing us to closely rank major characters 
                in a manner comparable to expert evaluations. Our group member Nicolaj, a Game of Thrones aficionado, produced a sentiment 
                ranking of some of the most important characters in the series which our data-driven sentiment analysis aligns with pretty well . 
                This outcome demonstrates the power of leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques like Distilled BERT to 
                explore complex and multifaceted fictional universes like Game of Thrones.

        <div class="content">
            <p>When analyzing the sentiment of different communities throughout the seasons of Game of Thrones, 
                it was important to consider only those communities that had a significant impact on the series. 
                Thus, communities consisting of minor characters with only a brief appearance, such as prostitutes 
                or King’s Landing rioters, were excluded from the analysis.</p>

                <p>We analyzed the sentiment of five key communities in Game of Thrones.
                    These communities were focused on story arcs at King's Landing, Winterfell, 
                    Jon Snow's journey, Arya Stark's encounters, and Daenerys Targaryen's arc. The average sentiment of 
                    impactful characters was calculated for each season to track sentiment development.</p>

                <p>Notably, the sentiment of the Night's Watch, Arya Stark and Stark communities declines sharply in the first 
                    half of the series due to various threats and losses. Arya Stark's journey with Sandor Clegane after her flight from captivity is marked by a rapid increase in sentiment.
                   In contrast, the sentiment of Daenerys' 
                    community remains relatively positive, despite facing challenges 
                    such as losing her husband and child, and managing her conquered territories.</p>

                <p>Interestingly, Daenerys' community sentiment concludes with a positive sentiment score in season 8, 
                    which does not align with the events in the series, including her descent into madness 
                    and the death of her closest friends. This discrepancy highlights the complexities and 
                    limitations of sentiment analysis in capturing the nuances of such an intricate narrative.</p>

                Based on an analysis of the characters in Game of Thrones, a sentiment ranking was created for the top 10 most 
                important characters, and this was compared to an "expert" ranking. The characters were evaluated based on their 
                experiences throughout the series and how their overall sentiment was impacted by those experiences.

                Tyrion Lannister, despite facing multiple challenges, managed to have several enjoyable seasons and humorous dialogues, 
                ultimately becoming the "Hand of the King." Jon Snow witnessed the deaths of most of his family and the horrors of the
                White Walkers, but found some inner peace after being exiled. Daenerys Targaryen went from being sold as a wife to a warlord, 
                to birthing three dragons, gaining an army, freeing slaves, and becoming queen. Although she ultimately went insane and 
                faced multiple hardships, her overall sentiment was not as negative as some other characters.

            </p>
            <p>
                Cersei Lannister spent most of the show in control of King's Landing and was a terrible person who made various threats. 
                Despite this, her luxurious lifestyle and lack of captivity (aside from a brief period in season 5) helped balance her 
                sentiment. Jaime Lannister underwent a significant character arc, changing for the better, and although he lost his hand
                and was held captive at times, his overall sentiment was not overly negative.

            </p>
            <p>
                Arya Stark went through terrible things on her journey, resulting in mostly negative sentiment. Sansa Stark endured one 
                tyrant after another and was humiliated and tortured, resulting in mostly negative sentiment, although she ultimately 
                became the Queen of the North. Davos Seaworth lost his king Stannis halfway through the series, as well as his son in 
                season 2, but his sentiment was mostly positive compared to the rest of the characters on the show. Samwell Tarly was 
                mostly in good spirits, despite some initial challenges when he arrived at Castle Black, and the sentiment surrounding 
                him was positive.

            </p>
            <p>
                Bran Stark should mostly be classified as neutral since he, as the Three-Eyed Raven, is cut off from emotions.

            </p>
            <p>
                When comparing the sentiment model's average sentiment ranking to the expert's ranking, the sentiment model was able to capture most of the characters' sentiments. The expert rankings were as follows:

            <p>It is evident that throughout the television show, Game of Thrones, Tyrion Lannister has the most lines of dialogue. 
                This can be attributed to his sharp wit and tongue, as well as his prominent role as an advisor throughout all eight seasons. 
                As main characters are killed off throughout the series, the focus of the show shifts to other key characters, such as 
                Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen, whose dialogue numbers increase significantly from season 6 onwards.
                
                Cersei Lannister's character arc takes place primarily between seasons 3 and 6, where she must navigate complex power 
                dynamics at court and deal with the aftermath of her children's deaths. Her dialogue count increases significantly during 
                season 5, where she briefly becomes the character with the most lines. This shift in focus towards Cersei's character 
                highlights the importance of her storyline in the middle seasons of the show.</p>
                
            <p>Another character whose dialogue count fluctuates throughout the show is Theon Greyjoy. At the beginning of the series, 
                Theon has a significant number of lines, but his dialogue count drops drastically during season 2 after he is captured 
                and tortured. This can be attributed to the breakdown of his will and the trauma he experiences during his captivity.

        </graph_section>

        <div class="content">
            <p>When analyzing the importance of characters in Game of Thrones, it is essential to consider not only the number 
                of scenes or the number of dialogues alone, as each of these tells something different about the importance of a
                 character. To create a more comprehensive evaluation, a new dataset was generated that combines the number of 
                 scenes and dialogues, each weighted at 50%.</p>
                
            <p>Based on this weighted dataset, it becomes clear that Tyrion Lannister is one of the most important characters 
                in the show, despite not having the highest number of scenes. His sharp wit and cunning strategies make him a 
                crucial player in the game of thrones, and his dialogue-driven scenes are often pivotal in moving the plot forward.</p>
                
            <p>Similarly, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen, who have the highest number of scenes, are also among the most 
                important characters in the show. Their story arcs are central to the overall narrative, and their decisions 
                and actions have significant consequences for the other characters.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, some characters who may have a high number of scenes but fewer dialogues, such as Bran Stark, 
                are not necessarily as important in the grand scheme of things. Bran's journey from a young boy to the Three-Eyed 
                Raven is a significant character arc, but his lack of emotions and reduced dialogue in later seasons means he is 
                less active and has less impact on the plot than other main characters.</p>
                
            <p>Overall, the weighted importance of characters in Game of Thrones reveals that the number of scenes or 
                dialogues alone does not determine a character's significance in the show. Instead, it's their actions, decisions, 
                and impact on the plot that truly define their importance.</p>

            <p>Our network was constructed with characters as nodes and co-scene appearances as edges. Edge weights were determined by the number of scenes in which characters co-appeared. We used the built-in Python function *community_louvain* to create communities and added the community number as an attribute for each node.</p>
            <p>Modularity measures the network's division into distinct communities based on node connections. A modularity score above 0.4 is generally considered good and indicates well-defined communities. In our analysis, we achieved a modularity above 0.4, suggesting the presence of meaningful communities within the Game of Thrones network.</p>

        </graph_section>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The number of different people each character has shared scenes with can tell us a lot about the character's journey and 
                impact on the overall plot. One way to visualize this is by creating a timelapse of the number of different people each 
                character has interacted with throughout the series.</p>

            <p>While most of the main characters eventually meet up at some point, some characters have had more unique interactions 
                with others due to their travels or story arcs. For example, Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, and Sansa Stark have traveled 
                to multiple locations early in the series and have had the most diverse set of interactions with other characters. 
                Arya Stark, in particular, benefits from a journey that has led her across almost every single main location and even 
                across the Narrow Sea.</p>

            <p>This timelapse reveals interesting insights into the characters' development and relationships with others. For example, 
                Jon Snow initially has limited interactions with characters outside of the Night's Watch and his family, but this changes 
                as he becomes more involved in the larger conflicts of the realm. On the other hand, Cersei Lannister's interactions mainly 
                revolve around her family and court intrigue, reflecting her focus on consolidating power in King's Landing.</p>

            <p>A word cloud based on tf-idf was generated using the entire script of Game of Thrones, with the top 1000 most common words removed. This technique helps to identify the most important and distinctive words used in the script, by giving more weight to words that are relatively rare but occur frequently in a particular episode or scene.</p>

                <p>The resulting word cloud shows a range of themes and topics that are central to the show, including battles, politics, love, and betrayal. Some of the most prominent words include "king", "winter", "queen", "lord", "dragon", "kill", "fuck", "bastard", "drink", "wine", and "murder".</p>
                
                <p>Overall, the word cloud provides a visual representation of the most important and distinctive words used in Game of Thrones, and offers insights into the show's themes, characters, and plotlines.</p>

            <p>The success of our Game of Thrones network analysis was facilitated by the comprehensive dataset available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/albenft/game-of-thrones-script-all-seasons">Kaggle*</a>, which was originally from <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Game-of-thrones">Genius.com</a> . This dataset, which included character information, relationships, scenes, and dialogue scripts from all eight seasons, saved us time and effort in data collection and cleaning.</p>
            <p>We focused on character connections based on shared scenes and other attributes, allowing us to explore the complex social structure of the series and confirm various hypotheses. Our prior knowledge of the show enabled us to analyze results with expert-level depth.</p>
            <p>Another successful aspect was text analysis, utilizing over 20,000 dialogues for sentiment analysis. We employed a pre-trained model to capture sentiment for each dialogue, character, and community, revealing character development and themes throughout the series.</p>
        
            <p>Using a pre-made dataset presented limitations such as errors or inconsistencies in character names, which required time-consuming corrections. Gathering data via an API or web scraping could have improved accuracy but also posed challenges. Additionally, navigating the complex dataset consisting of various JSON and CSV files demanded considerable time and effort.</p>
            <p>Being selective with information was necessary to stay within the project's scope and focus on specific areas of interest. Partitioning the network based on shared scenes led to some communities with irrelevant characters, a common issue in large networks, resulting in only five significant communities of interest.</p>
            <p>Despite these limitations, we gleaned valuable insights into the complex social structure and character sentiments in Game of Thrones. Our analysis serves as a starting point for future exploration and research, with potential improvements in data collection and analysis methods.</p>
